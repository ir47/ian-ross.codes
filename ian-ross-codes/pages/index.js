        <p>I am currently learning Next.js which this website is being built with. My plan is to use the website as a showcase for the work I have completed
        over my time at univeristy and any personal projects I have also created.</p>

          (This is a sample website - youâ€™ll be building a site like this on{' '}
          <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn">our Next.js tutorial</a>.)
